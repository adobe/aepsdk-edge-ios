## Events handled by Edge

The following events are handled by the Edge extension client-side.

### Edge consent response content

This event contains the latest consent preferences synced with the SDK. The Edge Network extension reads the current data collection consent settings stored in the `collect` property and adjusts its internal queueing behavior based on the value as follows:

| Value | Description | Behavior |
| ----- | ----------- | -------- |
| `y` | Yes | Hits are sent |
| `n` | No | Hits are dropped and not sent |
| `p` | Pending | Hits are queued until `y`/`n` is set; when set, queued events follow the value's behavior |

#### Event data payload definition<!-- omit in toc -->

| Key | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| consents | <code>[String:&nbsp;Any]</code> | No | XDM formatted consent preferences containing current collect consent settings. If not specified, defaults to `p` (pending) until the value is updated. |

-----

### Edge identity reset complete

This event signals that [Identity for Edge Network](https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-edgeidentity-ios) has completed [resetting all identities](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/identity-for-edge-network/api-reference/#resetidentities) usually following a call to [`MobileCore.resetIdentities()`](https://developer.adobe.com/client-sdks/documentation/mobile-core/api-reference/#resetidentities).

When this event is received, the Edge extension queues it up and removes the cached internal `state:store` settings. If other events are queued before this event, those events will be processed first in the order they were received.

-----

### Edge request content

This event is a request to process and deliver an Experience event to Edge Network. This event is captured by the Edge Network extension's event listener in the Event Hub for processing and sent to Edge Network.

If the required `xdm` key is not present in the event data payload, the event is not sent to Edge Network. To learn more about Experience Data Model (XDM), please read the [XDM system overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/xdm/home.html)â€‹.

### Edge request identity

This event is a request to get the current location hint being used by the Edge Network extension in requests to the Edge Network. The Edge Network location hint may be used when building the URL for Edge Network requests to hint at the server cluster to use.

-----

### Edge update identity

This event is a request to set the Edge Network location hint used by the Edge Network extension in requests to Edge Network.

> **Warning**
> Use caution when setting the location hint. Only use valid [location hints defined within the `EdgeNetwork` scope](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge-network-server-api/location-hints.html). An invalid location hint value will cause all Edge Network requests to fail with a `404` response code.

## Events dispatched by Edge

The following events are dispatched by the Edge extension client-side.

### Edge content complete
This event is a response to an [Edge request content](#edge-request-content) event and is sent when the Edge Network request is complete. This event is only dispatched when requested by the request content event when the `request` payload object contains the property `sendCompletion` with boolean value `true`.

#### Event data payload definition<!-- omit in toc -->

| Key | Value type | Required | Description |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ----------- |
| requestId | `String` | Yes | The ID (`UUID`) of the batched Edge Network request tied to the event that requested the completion response. |

-----

### Edge error response content

This event is an error response to an originating event. If there are multiple error responses for a given triggering event, separate error event instances will be dispatched for each error.

### Edge identity response

This event is a response to the [Edge request identity event](#edge-request-identity) with data payload containing `locationHint = true` and provides the location hint being used by the Edge Network extension in requests to the Edge Network. The Edge Network location hint may be used when building the URL for Edge Network requests to hint at the server cluster to use.

-----

### Edge location hint result

This event tells the Edge Network extension to persist the location hint to the data store. This event is constructed using the response fragment from the Edge Network service for a sent XDM Experience Event; Edge Network extension does not modify any values received and constructs a response event with the event source and data payload as-is.

### Edge response content

This event is a response to an [Edge request content](#edge-request-content) event. This event is constructed using the response fragment from the Edge Network service for a sent XDM Experience Event; Edge Network extension does not modify any values received and constructs a response event with the event source and data payload as-is. This event is only dispatched if the response fragment doesn't define a type, otherwise an event using the response type is dispatched such as a [state:store](#edge-state-store) or [locationHint:result](#edge-location-hint-result).
