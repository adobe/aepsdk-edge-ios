# Adobe Experience Platform Edge Mobile Extension

## About this project

The Adobe Experience Platform Edge Mobile extension allows you to send data to the Adobe Experience Platform (AEP) from a mobile application. This extension allows you to implement Adobe Experience Cloud capabilities in a more robust way, serve multiple Adobe solutions though one network call, and simultaneously forward this information to the Adobe Experience Platform.

The AEP Edge Mobile Extension is an extension for the [Adobe Experience Platform SDK](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/acp-sdks) and requires the `AEPCore` and `AEPServices` extensions for event handling, as well as the `AEPIdentity` extension for retrieving the ECID. 

To learn more about this extension, read [Adobe Experience Platform Edge Mobile Extension](https://aep-sdks.gitbook.io/docs/beta/experience-platform-extension).

## Requirements
- Xcode 11.0 (or newer)
- Swift 5.1 (or newer)

## Installation

These are currently the supported installation options:

### [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html)

```ruby
# Podfile
use_frameworks!

# for app development, include all the following pods
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
  	pod 'AEPEdge'
  	pod 'AEPCore'
  	pod 'AEPIdentity'
end

# for extension development, include AEPCore, AEPEdge and their dependencies
target 'YOUR_TARGET_NAME' do
  	pod 'AEPEdge'
  	pod 'AEPCore'
end
```

Replace `YOUR_TARGET_NAME` and then, in the `Podfile` directory, type:

```ruby
$ pod install
```

### [Swift Package Manager](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager)

To add the AEPEdge Package to your application, from the Xcode menu select:

`File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...`

Enter the URL for the AEPEdge package repository: `https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-edge-ios.git`.

When prompted, make sure you change the branch to `main`. (Once the repo is public, we will reference specific tags/versions instead of a branch)

Alternatively, if your project has a `Package.swift` file, you can add AEPEdge directly to your dependencies:

```
dependencies: [
	.package(url: "https://github.com/adobe/aepsdk-edge-ios.git", .branch: "main"),
targets: [
   	.target(name: "YourTarget",
    				dependencies: ["AEPEdge"],
          	path: "your/path"),
    ]
]
```

### Binaries

To generate an `AEPEdge.xcframework`, run the following command:

```ruby
$ make archive
```

This generates the xcframework under the `build` folder. Drag and drop all the `.xcframeworks` to your app target in Xcode.

## Development

The first time you clone or download the project, you should run the following from the root directory to setup the environment:

~~~
make pod-install
~~~

Subsequently, you can make sure your environment is updated by running the following:

~~~
make pod-update
~~~

#### Open the Xcode workspace
Open the workspace in Xcode by running the following command from the root directory of the repository:

~~~
make open
~~~

#### Command line integration

You can run all the test suites from command line:

~~~
make test
~~~
